# Pacific Trails Resort
**Pacific Trails Resort** is a website I created for the HTML/CSS course at *Davis Technical College*.

You can few the site [here](https://shmolty.github.io/PacificTrailsResort/index.html)

## Things I learned
* Flexbox
* Grid
* Background color
* Lots of general styling and sizing
* Adding links
* And much more!

One of my favorite things that I applied was the concept of a wrapper to create a centered site that pops out using css:
``` css
#wrapper {
    margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;
    width: 80%;
    background-color: #90C7E3;
    background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, #FFFFFF, #90C7E3);
    min-width: 960px;
    max-width: 2048px;
    box-shadow: 3px 3px 3px #333333;
    border: 1px solid #000033;
}
```
Below is an image that I used in the site, which paints a pretty picture of what the resort might feel like.
